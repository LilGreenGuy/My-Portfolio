# This is my personal website landing page.

## Created in a few hours time on a random Monday, I finally stopped procrastinating on making a landing page for a personal site for myself.

## Tools used:

### Vanilla JavaScript,

### Vanilla HTML, and

### Vanilla CSS.

## Future plans:

### I would like to expand the website further, bundling some of the projects into the website itself, likely when I expand the site to be more than just a simple static page.

### I plan on working on more projects that I'll be adding to the site as well.
